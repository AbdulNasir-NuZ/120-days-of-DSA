Q. What is Data Struture ?

   > It's a **way of Organize Data.**  After Organising data it becomes easy to process. 

Q. How many types of Data Structure are there ?

  > There are **2 types of Data Structure** :
  
  **1. Linear :**
  - Data elements arranged in sequencial manner,
  - where each element is connected to privious and next elements, 
  - Easy to travers the each element with single level,
  - Element stored in sequencial order in the memory
  - Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue.
  
  **2. Non -Linear :**
  - Data elements are not in sequences,
  - Where element is connected to one and another through different paths,
  - Takes some more time, to travers the each elements as it stored in Multi-level,
  - Tree, Graph
