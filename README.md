  Day 1 
 
Q. What is Data Struture ?
--------------------------------------------
   It's a way of Organize Data.  After Organizing data it becomes easy to process it 

Q. What are types of Data Structure ?
   There are 2 types of Data Structure :
   a> Linear :
    - Data elements arranged in sequencial manner,
    - where each element is connected to privious and next elements, 
    - Easy to travers the each element with single level,
    - Element stored in sequencial order in the memory
    -  Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue.

   b> Non -Linear :
    - Data elements are not in sequences,
    - Where element is connected to one and another through different paths,
    - Takes some more time, to travers the each elements as it stored in Multi-level,
    -  Tree, Graph
              
Q. what is an Algorithm ?
  Set of instructions to perform a given task or to solve a given problem statements.
